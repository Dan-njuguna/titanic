# Titanic Surviror Prediction Dataset

- In the North Atlantic Ocean, on 15 April 1912, due to collision with an iceberg, the **great titianic** ship sunk killing hundreds of individuals.
- There were survivors in the incidently and we can reportedly suggest that there were factors that made them survivor.
- From the passenge Data on the ship, we will create a Machine Learning Model that predicts if a person survived or not, given a few features(characteristics) on the ship data.
- Let's delve deep!ðŸ¦¾
